This code will create a simple web application that displays the secret and user that are passed in the query string. For example, if you visit the application at localhost:3000

To run the application, you can use the following command:
-node index.js
Once the application is running, you can visit it at localhost:3000 in your browser.

This code will create a simple web application that allows the user to enter a secret and a user. The secret and user are then posted to the server using an XMLHttpRequest request. The server code will then store the secret and user in a database.
